# Software PWM
This lab required to use software PWM to make an lee=d blink for the MSP430 boards. To do this multiple pieces of code where needed. Each board had LEDS and buttons connected to different pins. 
The code for all 5 boards had the same header file. This file was the #include<msp430.h>. This contains all the built in functions for the msp430.
Inside the void function the watchdog timer has to be stopped,this is done by
the code WDTCTL=WDTPW +WDTHOLD. This code makes sure the processor is not stuck in an infinite
loop. The next step is to configure the GPIO pins.

#SETTING GPIO
This step is different for each board. The description for each board is shown below.
BUTTONS:
G2: P1.3
5529:P2.1 P1.1
FR2311: P1.1
FR6989:P1.1 P1.2
5994: P5.6 P5.5

LEDS:
G2: P1.0 P1.6
5529:P1.0 P1.1
FR2311: P1.0 P2.0
FR6989:P1.0 P9.7
5994: P1.0 P1.1
 To set the LEDS as outputs, the G2 P1.0 will be used as an example. The code used
 is P1DIR |= BIT0; This will set P1 to 1 and the rest of the pins to 0. Setting P1 to 1
 allows it to be an output.
 To set the button as an input, the same approach is taken but the pin will be an 
 input. The code "P1DIR |= BIT0;" will set pin 1.3 to be an input for the button
 on the G2.
 The next part is to set the LED to off. This done by the code:
 P1OUT &= ~BIT0;
 
 The next part is to enable a button interrupt, clear the interrupt flag, and enable the pull up
 resistor for the button. The code is shown below.
 P1IE |= BIT3; // P1.3 interrupt enabled
P1IFG &= ~BIT3; // Clear P1.3
 P1REN |= BIT3;   // Enable Pull Up resistor  on PIN 1.3
 
 The next part allows the interrupts to be enabled. The code is:
 __bis_SR_register(GIE); // Enable all interrupts
 
 #BUTTON INTERRUPT
#pragma vector=PORT1_VECTOR
__interrupt void PORT_1(void)
{
  switch(button)       //if button is off turn on.
  {case 0: button=1;
  break;
  case 1: button=0;   //if button is on turn off
  break;
  }

}
#Timer Interrupt
// Timer A0 interrupt service routine
#pragma vector=TIMER0_A0_VECTOR
__interrupt void Timer_A0 (void)
{
   blink ^=blink;         //toggle the led.

  if(button==1)
  { value+=100;   //increase the pwm
  }
  if(button==0)     //iff button is not pressed, keep value the same
  {value=value;}
}


#DIFFERENCES IN BOARDS
Besides the difference in LEDS and BUTTON pins, one piece of code is different for one
of the boards. The code below is needed for the 5994.
PM5CTL0 &= ~LOCKLPM5;
